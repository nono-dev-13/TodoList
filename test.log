Remaining self deprecation notices (1)

  1x: Method "Doctrine\Persistence\ObjectRepository::findAll()" might add "array" as a native return type declaration in the future. Do the same in implementation "App\Repository\TaskRepository" now to avoid errors or add an explicit @return annotation to suppress this message.

Remaining indirect deprecation notices (1)

  1x: The "Monolog\Logger" class is considered final. It may change without further notice as of its next major version. You should not extend it from "Symfony\Bridge\Monolog\Logger".
